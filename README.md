Hi there, my names Paul

ABOUT ME

I'm an aspiring Cybersecurity Professional with a profound interest in technology and the security of the internet.

OBJECTIVE

My journey with technology and the internet started in high school as a teenager. With the ever-growing world of the internet, it is creating many threats in many forms. Since becoming a father this has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I'm now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to become a Cybersecurity Analyst  or Cybersecurity Engineer.
